# PrivacyFence

**PrivacyFence** is an enterprise AI governance platform for macOS that sits between Claude (via MCP) and your personal data sources. Every time Claude tries to read an email, open a file, or fetch a Slack message, PrivacyFence intercepts the request and requires your approval before any data reaches the AI.

---

## Why PrivacyFence?

Organizations are rapidly adopting AI assistants, but existing access control models were designed for people — not autonomous AI agents. As AI becomes capable of independently reading emails, documents, chats, and business systems, organizations need a new governance model that balances productivity with privacy, security, and regulatory compliance.

PrivacyFence introduces a governance layer between AI assistants and enterprise systems. It keeps humans in control of sensitive information while allowing AI to become a trusted productivity tool rather than an unmanaged security risk.

## Who is PrivacyFence for?

- **CIOs and CTOs** introducing AI into the enterprise
- **CISOs and Information Security teams**
- **AI Governance and Compliance leaders**
- **Enterprise IT administrators**
- **Developers** building AI-enabled workflows
- **Organizations** adopting AI under GDPR and the EU AI Act

## Why existing approaches fall short

| Existing approach | PrivacyFence |
|---|---|
| Block AI | Enable AI safely |
| Trust the AI client | Independent governance layer |
| Static permissions | Context-aware human approval |
| Limited visibility | Complete audit trail |
| One-size-fits-all access | Fine-grained policy control |

## How it works

![PrivacyFence architecture: Claude talks to the ephemeral bridge over MCP stdio, the bridge forwards every call over a Unix socket to the persistent daemon, which runs it through auto-accept rules, the review gate, and the audit log before any connector reaches a personal data source.](docs/images/architecture.svg)

**`privacyfence-bridge`** — an ephemeral MCP server spawned by Claude on each session. It auto-starts the daemon if it is not already running, fetches the connector manifest, and forwards every tool call over a Unix socket. Claude only ever talks to the bridge; the bridge carries no credentials.

**`privacyfence-app`** — the persistent daemon that owns all credentials, connectors, the review gate, and the audit log. Only one instance runs at a time (enforced via a lock file). It starts automatically at login via a LaunchAgent.

---

## Review model

Every tool call passes through one of three gate values:

| Gate | Behaviour |
|------|-----------|
| `auto` | Passed through immediately, logged as `auto_accepted` |
| `review` | Approval requested in Claude Cowork (see below) |
| `popup` | Approval requested via PrivacyFence native popup |

### Two flows by direction

> **Note on MCP annotations (since v0.4.9):** the bridge advertises *every*
> tool — reads and writes alike — to Claude as `readOnlyHint = true` /
> `destructiveHint = false`. This is intentional. See
> [Why every tool is advertised as read-only](#why-every-tool-is-advertised-as-read-only) below.

**Tool → Claude (reads)**

When the gate is `review`, a prompt appears in Claude Cowork showing a minimal preview of the request:

- **Accept** — data is returned to Claude
- **Deny** — request is blocked; Claude receives an error
- **Show Details** — PrivacyFence opens a scrollable native popup with the full content (e.g. the email body), which then offers **Accept** or **Deny**

**Claude → Tool (writes / actions)**

Claude already describes the action it is about to take in the chat. When the gate is `popup`, PrivacyFence opens a native popup showing the full action details with **Accept** or **Deny**. There is no intermediate Cowork step.

| `gmail_remove_label` | write | popup | — | From, subject, label name |
| `gmail_archive_message` | write | popup | — | From, subject, confirmation that message stays in All Mail |

### Google Drive

**Auth:** OAuth2

| Tool | Dir | Gate | Cowork preview | Details popup |
|------|-----|------|----------------|---------------|
| `drive_list_files` | read | auto | — | — |
| `drive_get_file_metadata` | read | auto | — | — |
| `drive_list_folder` | read | auto | — | — |
| `drive_list_shared_drives` | read | auto | — | — |

| `drive_download_file` | read | popup | — | File name, owner, size, save path |
| `drive_write_file_content` | write | popup | — | File name, owner, new content (plain text) |
| `drive_upload_file` | write | popup | — | File name, size, destination folder |
| `drive_write_doc_content` | write | popup | — | File name, owner, Markdown preview (headings, bold, italic, links, lists rendered as rich formatting in the Google Doc) |
| `drive_move_file` | write | popup | — | File name, from folder → to folder |

| `drive_sheets_add_sheet` | write | popup | — | Spreadsheet name, owner, new tab title/dimensions |
| `drive_sheets_rename_sheet` | write | popup | — | Spreadsheet name, owner, tab id, new title |
| `drive_sheets_format_range` | write | popup | — | Spreadsheet name, owner, range, formatting being applied |

Google Sheets is not a separate connector — the `drive_sheets_*` tools live on the Drive
connector and reuse its OAuth grant (the Sheets API accepts the same `drive` scope). There is
intentionally no delete-sheet tool: `drive_sheets_rename_sheet` is the sanctioned way to mark a
tab for removal (e.g. rename it to `TO BE DELETED - <original title>`) — you delete it by hand
in the Sheets UI. `drive_sheets_write_range` has no separate "set formula" tool either — a cell
string starting with `=` is evaluated as a formula, exactly like typing it into the Sheets UI.

### Slack

**Auth:** OAuth2 (browser sign-in), user token scope. Sees exactly what you see — no bot to invite. See [docs/slack-setup.md](docs/slack-setup.md).

| Tool | Dir | Gate | Cowork preview | Details popup |
|------|-----|------|----------------|---------------|
| `slack_list_channels` | read | auto | — | — |
| `slack_get_channel_history` | read | review | channel name, message count, first message (80 chars) | All messages |
| `slack_get_thread_replies` | read | review | channel name, thread starter (80 chars), reply count | All replies |
| `slack_search_messages` | read | review | query, result count | All results |
| `slack_send_message` | write | popup | — | Channel name, full message text (optional `mark_unread=true` leaves the message unread after sending; requires `mark` scope) |

### Google Calendar

**Auth:** OAuth2

| Tool | Dir | Gate | Cowork preview | Details popup |
|------|-----|------|----------------|---------------|
| `calendar_list_calendars` | read | auto | — | — |
| `calendar_list_events` | read | auto | — | — |
| `calendar_get_free_busy` | read | auto | — | — (returns full events when calendar access is available; falls back to busy-slot list otherwise) |
| `calendar_list_rooms` | read | auto | — | — (lists Google Workspace meeting rooms with name, email, building, floor, capacity; requires Workspace admin directory access) |
| `calendar_get_event_details` | read | review | title, time, organizer, attendee count | Description, full attendee list, conferencing link, file attachments (e.g. Gemini meeting notes/transcript) |
| `calendar_create_event` | write | popup | — | Title, time, attendees, description, location, Google Meet flag, room bookings |
| `calendar_update_event` | write | popup | — | Title, time, fields changing (old → new), Google Meet flag, room bookings |

### Google Contacts

**Auth:** OAuth2

| Tool | Dir | Gate | Cowork preview | Details popup |
|------|-----|------|----------------|---------------|
| `contacts_list` | read | auto | — | — |
| `contacts_search` | read | auto | — | — |
| `contacts_get` | read | auto | — | — |
| `contacts_update` | write | popup | — | Contact name, fields changing (old → new) |
| `contacts_create` | write | popup | — | Name, fields being set |
| `contacts_add_label` | write | popup | — | Contact name, label (creates the label if it doesn't exist) |
| `contacts_remove_label` | write | popup | — | Contact name, label |

Contact deletion is not supported by this connector.

Google's People API blends personally-saved contacts together with Workspace
directory profiles (colleagues) into a single response by default. `contacts_list`,
`contacts_search`, and `contacts_get` each accept a `source` parameter
(`personal`, `directory`, or `both` — default `both`) to split them apart, and
every returned contact carries a `source` field (`personal`, `directory`, `both`
if it's a saved contact who's also a colleague, or `other` for unclassifiable
entries) plus the raw `source_types` it was derived from. `contacts_get` fails
if the fetched resource doesn't match the requested `source`. Directory search
(`contacts_search` with `source="directory"`) is limited to directory profiles
you already have some contact history with — there is no full company-directory
search under this connector's OAuth scope.

### Telegram

**Auth:** Telethon (MTProto). Reads your chats as you, not as a bot.

| Tool | Dir | Gate | Cowork preview | Details popup |

## Auto-accept rules

Routine, low-risk requests can be approved automatically without a prompt. Rules are configured per operation in `config/settings.yaml` under `auto_accept_rules`. When a rule matches, the gate is bypassed and the request is logged as `auto_accepted`.

### Available rules

**Gmail**

| Rule | Matches when… |
|------|--------------|
| `i_am_sender` | The authenticated account is the sender |
| `i_am_sole_recipient` | The only recipient is the authenticated account |
| `trusted_sender_domain` | Sender's domain is in the allowlist |
| `label_match` | Message carries one of the specified labels |
| `age_threshold_days` | Message is older than N days |
| `no_attachments` | Message has no attachments |

These apply to Gmail's read tools. Gmail's write tools (`gmail_create_draft`, `gmail_reply_draft`,
`gmail_reply_all_draft`, `gmail_add_label`, `gmail_remove_label`) have their own rules:

| Rule | Matches when… |
|------|--------------|
| `to_is_myself` | Every recipient of the draft/reply is the authenticated account itself |
| `approved_recipient_domain` | Every recipient's domain is in the allowlist |
| `label_name_allowlist` | The label being added/removed is in the allowlist |

**Google Drive**

| Rule | Matches when… |
|------|--------------|
| `i_am_owner` / `created_by_me` | Authenticated account owns the file |
| `approved_folder` | File is in an approved folder (by Drive folder ID) |
| `approved_sandbox_folder` | File is in an approved sandbox folder |
| `move_within_approved_folders` | Move operation stays within approved folders |
| `file_type_allowlist` | File MIME type is in the allowlist |
| `created_this_session` | File was created by Claude in the current session |
| `shared_drive_exclusion` | File is NOT on a shared drive |

`drive_upload_file` additionally supports `parent_folder_allowlist` (matches when the upload's
destination folder ID is in the allowlist).

The same rules apply to the `drive_sheets_*` tools, under their own operation keys so they can be
configured independently of plain-file Drive operations: `sheets.read_values` (`i_am_owner`,
`created_by_me`, `approved_folder`, `created_this_session`, `shared_drive_exclusion`),
`sheets.write_range` / `sheets.add_sheet` (`i_am_owner`, `approved_sandbox_folder`,
`created_this_session`), and `sheets.rename_sheet` / `sheets.format_range` (`i_am_owner`,
`created_this_session`). A spreadsheet is a Drive file, so e.g. `created_this_session` fires for
a spreadsheet `drive_sheets_create` made earlier in the same conversation.

All five `sheets.*` operations also accept `approved_spreadsheet`, which scopes a rule to one
specific spreadsheet — optionally narrowed to one tab within it:

```yaml
auto_accept_rules:
  sheets.read_values:
    - rule: approved_spreadsheet
      value:
        - spreadsheet_id: "1BxiMVs0XRA5nFMdKvBdBZjgmUUqptlbs74OgVE2upms"   # whole spreadsheet, any tab
        - spreadsheet_id: "1AbCdEf..."
          tab: "Budget"                                                   # only this tab
```

`spreadsheet_id` is the ID from the sheet's URL
(`docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/<spreadsheet_id>/edit`). `tab` is optional — omit it to approve
every tab of that spreadsheet. When present, `tab` means the tab's **name** (e.g. `"Sheet1"`) for
`sheets.read_values` / `sheets.write_range`, since that's all range_a1 carries (`"Sheet1!A1:C10"`);
for `sheets.rename_sheet` / `sheets.format_range` it means the tab's **numeric** `sheet_id` (from
`drive_sheets_get_metadata`) as a string, since those tools address the tab that way instead.
`sheets.add_sheet` has no existing tab to scope to, so only bare `spreadsheet_id` entries apply
there.

Clicking **Accept All** on a "Read Sheet Values" prompt proposes exactly this rule — scoped to the
spreadsheet and tab you just read — rather than a broader ownership- or folder-based rule.

**Slack**

| Rule | Matches when… |
|------|--------------|
| `dm_with_myself` / `send_to_myself` | Target channel is a self-DM |
| `approved_channel` / `approved_recipient` | Channel ID is in the allowlist |
| `public_channels_only` | All messages are from public channels |
| `no_file_attachments` | Messages have no file attachments |
| `reply_in_existing_thread` | Message is a reply (has `thread_ts`) |

**Google Calendar**

| Rule | Matches when… |
|------|--------------|
| `i_am_organizer` | Authenticated account is the event organizer |
| `no_external_attendees` | All attendees share the same email domain |
| `personal_calendar` | Event is from a specified calendar ID |
| `past_event` | Event end time is in the past |
| `time_window_days` | Event starts within the next N days |
| `no_conferencing_link` | Event has no video conferencing link |

**Salesforce**

| Rule | Matches when… |
|------|--------------|
| `approved_object_types` | Object type (Account, Contact, …) is in the allowlist |
| `approved_report_ids` | Report ID is in the approved list |

**Google Contacts**

| Rule | Matches when… |
|------|--------------|
| `no_contact_info_change` | The update doesn't touch `emails` or `phones` (name/organization/notes-only edits) |

**Jira**

| Rule | Matches when… |
|------|--------------|
| `i_am_reporter` | Authenticated account is the issue's reporter |
| `i_am_assignee` | Authenticated account is the issue's assignee |
| `approved_project_keys` | Issue's project key is in the allowlist |

**Confluence**

| Rule | Matches when… |
|------|--------------|
| `i_am_author` | Authenticated account is the page's author |
| `approved_space_keys` | Page's space key is in the allowlist |

**Telegram**

| Rule | Matches when… |
|------|--------------|
| `approved_chats` | Chat ID is in the allowlist |
| `no_media_attachments` | Messages have no media attachments |

> **Google Contacts**: `contacts_list`, `contacts_search`, and `contacts_get` are unconditionally auto-accepted. `contacts_update`, `contacts_create`, `contacts_add_label`, and `contacts_remove_label` are all `popup`-gated; `no_contact_info_change` above is the only configurable auto-accept rule, and it applies only to `contacts_update`. Contact deletion is not supported. **Google Tasks**: all three read tools plus `tasks_list_task_lists` are unconditionally auto-accepted; the five write tools (`tasks_create_task`, `tasks_update_task`, `tasks_complete_task`, `tasks_uncomplete_task`, `tasks_move_task`) are `popup`-gated with no configurable auto-accept rule, matching every other connector's write behavior. **Telegram**: `telegram_list_chats` is unconditionally auto-accepted; `telegram_get_messages` and `telegram_search_messages` are `review`-gated by default but configurable via the rules above; `telegram_send_message` is `popup`-gated with no configurable rule. **Jira and Confluence** read tools (`jira_get_issue`, `confluence_get_page`, `confluence_get_page_by_title`) are `review`-gated by default but configurable via the rules above; their write tools have no configurable auto-accept rules and remain `popup`-gated.

---

## Audit log

Every decision — accepted, denied, or auto-accepted — is appended to a JSON-lines file in `logs/audit/YYYY-WNN.jsonl`. At startup, any week that has a `.jsonl` file but no `.xlsx` is automatically exported to a formatted Excel workbook with a colour-coded **Decisions** sheet and a **Summary** tab.

See [docs/connector-qa-testing.md](docs/connector-qa-testing.md) for a Claude Cowork prompt that drives every connector's tools end to end against real accounts — the fastest way to catch a gate, auto-accept rule, or connector client that's drifted from what's documented here.

## Security, privacy & compliance

For information security, IT, GDPR, and EU AI Act reviewers: see
[docs/security-and-compliance.md](docs/security-and-compliance.md) for the deployment model
(local, not SaaS), IT's connector-level access authority, the human-in-the-loop review model,
data handling, and PrivacyFence's positioning under GDPR and the AI Act.

---

## Installation

PrivacyFence splits configuration into two steps done by two different people:

1. **IT admin, once per organization:** register a cloud app for each service you want (Google,
   Slack, Salesforce, Atlassian) and package the result into one organization config bundle with
   `scripts/build_org_bundle.py`. See the "For IT admins" section of each doc below. Telegram is
   not part of this step — its `api_id`/`api_hash` identify the PrivacyFence app itself, not your
   organization, and are already baked into the release build.
2. **Every user, from the PrivacyFence menu bar:** install the bundle IT sent you, then click
   **Authenticate…** on each connector you want. Almost everywhere this opens your browser to sign
   in — Telegram is the only connector that instead asks for your phone number and a verification
   code, since MTProto has no browser-OAuth equivalent.

> See [docs/google-cloud-setup.md](docs/google-cloud-setup.md), [docs/slack-setup.md](docs/slack-setup.md), [docs/salesforce-setup.md](docs/salesforce-setup.md), [docs/atlassian-setup.md](docs/atlassian-setup.md), and [docs/telegram-setup.md](docs/telegram-setup.md) for the full walkthroughs.

### From the DMG (recommended)

The DMG carries both halves of PrivacyFence — the daemon and the Claude extension — so this is
the only download you need:

1. Download the latest `PrivacyFence-<version>.dmg` from the [Releases](../../releases) page.
2. Open the DMG, drag **PrivacyFenceApp.app** to `/Applications`.
3. **Releases aren't notarized yet**, so Gatekeeper will refuse the first launch with *"PrivacyFenceApp
   is damaged and can't be opened. You should move it to the Trash."* — this is not actual corruption,
   just macOS blocking an unsigned app downloaded from the internet. Right-click → Open does **not**
   bypass this on current macOS, and neither does any other helper script placed in the DMG (it
   inherits the same quarantine flag). The only fix is to clear the quarantine attribute yourself in
   Terminal:
   ```bash
   xattr -cr /Applications/PrivacyFenceApp.app
   ```
   Then launch it normally — the menu bar icon appears immediately, there's no setup wizard to walk
   through.
4. To start PrivacyFence automatically at login, install the LaunchAgent once:
   ```bash
   cp com.privacyfence.app.plist ~/Library/LaunchAgents/
   launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.privacyfence.app.plist
   ```
5. From the menu bar: **Organization Config → Install/Update Organization Config…**, and select
   the bundle your IT team sent you.
6. **Connectors → \<service\> → Authenticate…** for each connector you want, then quit and reopen
   PrivacyFence to activate them.
7. Still in the mounted DMG, double-click **PrivacyFence.mcpb** — Claude Desktop installs the
   MCP server for you (Settings → Extensions → Install Extension… happens automatically).

### From source

**Requirements:** Python 3.11+, macOS

```bash
git clone https://github.com/andras-tkcs/privacyfence
cd privacyfence
python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e .
```

Copy the config (privacy policy / auto-accept rules — no secrets live here):

```bash
cp src/privacyfence/resources/settings.yaml.example config/settings.yaml
```

Build (or obtain from IT) an organization config bundle, then authorize each connector you want —
either from the menu bar once `privacyfence-app` is running, or headlessly from the CLI:

```bash
python3 scripts/build_org_bundle.py --google-client-secret /path/to/client_secret.json -o org_config.json
mkdir -p ~/.privacyfence/org && cp org_config.json ~/.privacyfence/org/

privacyfence-app --gmail-oauth
privacyfence-app --drive-oauth
privacyfence-app --calendar-oauth
privacyfence-app --contacts-oauth
privacyfence-app --tasks-oauth
privacyfence-app --slack-oauth        # if the bundle has a Slack app
privacyfence-app --salesforce-oauth   # if the bundle has a Salesforce Connected App
privacyfence-app --atlassian-oauth    # if the bundle has an Atlassian OAuth app
privacyfence-app --telegram-setup     # phone+code sign-in (needs PRIVACYFENCE_TELEGRAM_API_ID/API_HASH env vars for a dev build)
```

Start the daemon:

```bash
privacyfence-app
```

---

## Connecting Claude

The daemon and the bridge are built and shipped separately:

- **PrivacyFenceApp.app** (built by `scripts/build_dmg.sh`) — the daemon: owns credentials,
  connectors, the review gate, the audit log, and the LaunchAgent. Install this first via the DMG.
- **PrivacyFence.mcpb** (built by `scripts/build_mcpb.sh`, from `PrivacyFenceBridge.spec`) — just
  the bridge: a small MCP server that talks to the daemon over a Unix socket. Install this into Claude.

### Option A: one-click extension (Claude Desktop)

`PrivacyFence.mcpb` ships inside the DMG alongside `PrivacyFenceApp.app` (see above) — just
double-click it and Claude Desktop installs the MCP server for you, no
`claude_desktop_config.json` editing.

The daemon (PrivacyFenceApp.app) must already be installed and configured first — the extension
only contains `privacyfence-bridge`, built from its own minimal dependency set (no google-auth,
slack_sdk, telethon, atlassian-python-api, rumps, or tkinter — that's why it's ~30MB instead of
the daemon's ~185MB).

To build both artifacts yourself:

```bash
pip install pyinstaller
brew install create-dmg
bash scripts/build_dmg.sh
```

This runs `scripts/build_mcpb.sh` as part of assembling the DMG. To build just the extension
on its own (e.g. for a quick local test without a full DMG), run `bash scripts/build_mcpb.sh`
directly — it produces `dist/PrivacyFence-<version>.mcpb`.

### Option B: manual MCP config (Claude Desktop, Claude Code, or other MCP clients)

Add the bridge to Claude's MCP config (`~/.claude/claude_desktop_config.json` or equivalent):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "privacyfence": {
      "command": "privacyfence-bridge"
    }
  }
}
```

If running from source, replace `privacyfence-bridge` with the full path to `.venv/bin/privacyfence-bridge`.

For Claude Code, you can skip editing JSON by running:

```bash
claude mcp add privacyfence privacyfence-bridge
```

---

## Building a DMG

```bash
pip install pyinstaller
bash scripts/build_dmg.sh
```

The script produces `dist/PrivacyFence-<version>.dmg` (containing `PrivacyFenceApp.app`).

## Architecture notes

- The bridge is stateless and disposable — Claude can kill and restart it at any time without losing any state. All state (credentials, tokens, filters, queue) lives in the daemon.
- IPC between the bridge and the daemon uses a newline-delimited JSON protocol over a Unix domain socket (`~/.privacyfence/privacyfence.sock`).
- The daemon uses two threads: the main thread runs the rumps menu bar app (a hard macOS requirement for AppKit) and an IPC thread runs the asyncio event loop serving the bridge socket. Approval popups are shown via `osascript` subprocesses and can be called from any thread.
- All tools are advertised to Claude with `readOnlyHint = true` — see below.

### Why every tool is advertised as read-only

Since **v0.4.9**, the bridge annotates *every* registered tool — reads and
writes alike — as `readOnlyHint = true`, `destructiveHint = false`,
`idempotentHint = true`, regardless of the tool's real `read_only` flag.

This is a deliberate trick, and it is safe because **PrivacyFence — not
Claude — performs the actual authorization**:

- MCP tool annotations are, by the spec's own wording, *"hints, not
  guarantees."* Claude Code / Cowork use them only to decide **which
  permission prompts to render** — they are a UI signal, never a security
  boundary.
- Write tools default to `destructiveHint = true`. On the **Team plan** that
  makes Cowork prompt on **every single call** and greys out *"Allow all for
  this task,"* with no org-level pre-approval available
  ([anthropics/claude-ai-mcp#491](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-ai-mcp/issues/491)).
  The result is a redundant approval wall on top of the one PrivacyFence
  already enforces.
- Every tool call is forwarded over IPC to the PrivacyFence daemon, which
  applies the per-tool **gate** (`auto` / `review` / `popup`), the
  **auto-accept rules**, and the **audit log** *before* any external read or
  write happens. That gate is the real, enforced control point. Presenting a
  uniformly read-only surface to Claude simply removes the duplicate,
  un-configurable client-side prompt and lets PrivacyFence's own gate do the
  checking.

The tool's true nature is still recorded internally (`spec.read_only`) for the
daemon's gating and the audit trail — only what Claude is *told* is overridden.
The MCP annotation is cosmetic; the daemon's decision is authoritative.
