# Platform support

PrivacyFence local mode is packaged for macOS, Windows, and Debian/Ubuntu Linux. Org mode is a Linux/server deployment path.

## Support matrix

| Platform | Distribution | Startup model | Release automation |
|---|---|---|---|
| macOS | signed/notarized DMG containing the PyInstaller app bundle and MCPB | packaged app/LaunchAgent path | `.github/workflows/build.yml` on `macos-latest` |
| Windows | Inno Setup installer containing the PyInstaller executable and MCPB | Task Scheduler entry created by the installer | `.github/workflows/build.yml` on `windows-latest` |
| Debian/Ubuntu local mode | self-contained `.deb` built from the PyInstaller onedir output | XDG autostart desktop entry | `.github/workflows/build.yml` on `ubuntu-latest` |
| Linux Python install | wheel/sdist with `privacyfence-app` console script | operator-managed process or `privacyfence.service` | PyPI publishing workflow |
| Linux org mode | Python/system service behind the configured reverse proxy and identity provider | operator-managed service | release smoke coverage in the build/test suite |

## Shared runtime architecture

All desktop platforms run the same Python daemon and embedded web UI. MCP clients connect to the daemon's `/mcp` Streamable HTTP endpoint. Claude Desktop uses the bundled Node/TypeScript stdio shim in `mcpb/shim/` to discover and proxy to that endpoint.

The daemon uses `portalocker` for the single-instance lock, so the locking abstraction is shared across POSIX and Windows. Platform-specific behavior is concentrated in packaging, process discovery/startup, filesystem locations, browser launching, and installer integration.

## macOS

The macOS app is defined by `PrivacyFenceApp.spec`. Release builds are produced by `scripts/build_dmg.sh` and the macOS job in `.github/workflows/build.yml`.

The packaged application keeps user state outside the application bundle. The release workflow signs and notarizes the app/DMG when the required signing credentials are configured.

## Windows

The Windows executable is defined by `PrivacyFenceApp.win.spec`. `scripts/build_installer.ps1` builds the application and invokes `installer/privacyfence.iss` to produce the installer.

The installer:

- installs PrivacyFence under Program Files;
- installs the bundled MCPB/shim assets;
- creates a Start Menu entry for the settings UI;
- creates a Task Scheduler entry for user-session startup;
- starts PrivacyFence after installation;
- removes the scheduled task on uninstall;
- preserves the user's PrivacyFence state directory on uninstall.

Optional signing is configured through `SIGN_CERT_PATH`, `SIGN_CERT_PASSWORD`, and optionally `SIGN_TIMESTAMP_URL`.

The `platform-windows` job in `.github/workflows/tests.yml` runs the full core Python suite on `windows-latest` on every PR, alongside the normal Ubuntu suite. Windows packaging itself (the installer build, silent install/autostart/uninstall) is exercised only by the release build workflow (`build.yml`'s `build-windows` job, tag/`workflow_dispatch`-triggered), not per PR — see "Known open items" below for its current live status.

## Debian/Ubuntu local mode

The local desktop package is defined by `PrivacyFenceApp.linux.spec`, `scripts/build_deb.sh`, `debian/`, and `resources/linux/privacyfence.desktop`.

The `.deb` installs the self-contained application under `/opt/privacyfence`, exposes `/usr/bin/privacyfence-app`, installs application icons, and installs an XDG autostart desktop entry under `/etc/xdg/autostart/`.

The XDG desktop autostart path is separate from the repository's `privacyfence.service`, which is the Python/system-service template rather than the desktop `.deb` startup mechanism.

Package removal does not delete per-user PrivacyFence state from the user's home directory.

## Architecture and CPU constraints

PyInstaller builds are native to the runner architecture. The current Debian release job produces the architecture supported by its Ubuntu runner rather than cross-compiling another CPU target.

## Verification boundaries

The repository distinguishes build automation from target-environment validation. Packaging workflows prove that release artifacts can be built and exercise their automated smoke tests; OS-native presentation and login-session behavior still require the relevant platform environment where automation does not cover it.

Remaining test-automation work is tracked only in [`automated-test-strategy-plan.md`](automated-test-strategy-plan.md).

## Known open items

- **Windows Task Scheduler autostart registration and crash-restart — fixed, verified by real
  `workflow_dispatch` runs; one different gap remains, in the CI test's own methodology, not the
  installer.** This mechanism went through several real, independently-found-and-fixed bugs before
  landing where it is now — see `installer/privacyfence-task.xml.tmpl`'s own header comment and
  `installer/privacyfence.iss`'s `[Code]` section for the full detail — and the early ones are worth
  naming here only because this bullet itself carried wrong theories about them at the time:
  `PrivilegesRequired=lowest`/non-elevation was never the cause; nor, in the end, was the `/ri`/`/du`
  and `/RU`-scoping pair of `schtasks /create` CLI-flag bugs this bullet previously described as the
  fix — those flags were superseded entirely once the mechanism moved to a real Task Scheduler XML
  task definition (`schtasks /create /xml`), which is what actually ships today.
  **The real, final blocker in that XML approach** was an `encoding="UTF-8"` declaration in the XML
  prolog: `schtasks.exe` hands the file to MSXML as a Unicode stream already, so a declaration
  claiming UTF-8 contradicted the stream the parser was already on and MSXML rejected the whole
  registration outright (`ERROR: The task XML is malformed. (1,40)::ERROR: unable to switch the
  encoding`) — on every install, silently, until `[Code]` was changed to actually capture and log
  `schtasks`'s own output. Fixed by dropping the encoding declaration entirely. Alongside it, the
  task definition also regained three elements an earlier simplification pass had dropped and that
  turned out to be load-bearing once registration itself started succeeding: `version="1.2"` on the
  root `<Task>` element (the schema version `<RestartOnFailure>` and `<MultipleInstancesPolicy>`
  actually need), `id` on `<Principal>`, and the matching `Context` on `<Actions>` — without that
  id/Context pair, the registered `GroupId` principal is never actually bound to anything that runs.
  **Real crash-restart-on-failure is now implemented, not just planned**: the task definition carries
  `<RestartOnFailure><Interval>PT1M</Interval><Count>3</Count></RestartOnFailure>`, closing
  [`automated-test-strategy-plan.md`](automated-test-strategy-plan.md) Phase 13's implementation (its
  own exit criteria — an automated CI test proving a real restart — are not yet met; see below for
  why).
  **What's still open is the CI test's own substitution for "someone signs in," not the installer.**
  `windows-graphical-session.yml`'s real-logon test now gets past installation and task registration
  and fails at the actual question it exists to ask: `schtasks /query /v` reports the task
  `Enabled`/`Ready`, scoped to the right group, pointing at the right exe, and simply never fired
  (`Last Result: 267011` / `SCHED_S_TASK_HAS_NOT_RUN`). The reason is that the test signs the
  throwaway account in via PowerShell's `Start-Process -Credential`
  (`CreateProcessWithLogonW`), which creates a logon session but not the Terminal Services *session*
  logon a `LogonTrigger` actually subscribes to — a hosted-runner limitation in the test's own
  substitution, not a defect in the shipped task definition. Three ways to close this gap have been
  proposed but none chosen yet: narrow the automated assertion to what CI can actually prove
  (definition correctness plus `schtasks /run` confirming the action starts the daemon as the right
  principal, leaving the trigger itself to manual QA), build a real session via RDP loopback, or
  retire this workflow and let Phase 6.2's packaged-installer smoke test be the automated Windows
  autostart gate. Check `windows-graphical-session.yml`'s own run history for the current result
  rather than trusting this note alone.
  None of this needed a dedicated bullet on its own here for the manual-QA/issue-closure part of it:
  that content now lives in [`release-testing.md`](release-testing.md)'s human-checks list
  (Windows-specific bullets — a real installer run on a clean Windows VM, OAuth loopback, the
  crash-restart check above, and a clean Add/Remove Programs uninstall) and as a standing comment on
  [privacyfence/privacyfence#121](https://github.com/privacyfence/privacyfence/issues/121) itself
  recording that it stays open until a real tagged release ships the signed installer and that QA
  has run against it — not duplicated here as well.
- **Linux org mode has not had a real end-to-end run against a live Ubuntu server**: a fresh Ubuntu
  host following `org-mode-setup-guide.md` verbatim, a real OIDC round trip against a real identity
  provider, and at least one live connector (Gmail) exercised through a real MCP client hitting the
  public `/mcp` URL. The `org-mode-smoke` CI job exercises the same daemon/MCP/approval/audit
  contract end to end, but against a synthetic, mocked identity provider — a different, narrower
  guarantee than a real deployment run.
